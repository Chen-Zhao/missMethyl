\usage{

}
\arguments{
\item{regions}{\code{GRanges} Object of DMR coordinates to test for GO term
enrichment.}

\item{all.cpg}{Character vector of all CpG sites tested. Defaults to all CpG
sites on the array.}

\item{collection}{A list of user specified gene sets to test. Can also be a
single character vector gene set. Gene identifiers must be Entrez Gene IDs.}

\item{array.type}{The Illumina methylation array used. Options are "450K" or
"EPIC". Defaults to "450K".}

\item{plot.bias}{Logical, if true a plot showing the bias due to the
differing numbers of probes per gene will be displayed.}

\item{prior.prob}{Logical, if true will take into account the probability of
significant differentially methylation due to numbers of probes per gene. If
false, a hypergeometric test is performed ignoring any bias in the data.}

\item{anno}{Optional. A \code{DataFrame} object containing the complete
array annotation as generated by the \code{\link{minfi}}
\code{\link{getAnnotation}} function. Speeds up execution, if provided.}

\item{equiv.cpg}{Logical, if true then equivalent numbers of cpgs are used
for odds calculation rather than total number cpgs. Only used if 
\code{prior.prob=TRUE}.}

\item{fract.counts}{Logical, if true then fractional counting of cpgs is used
to account for cgps that map to multiple genes. Only used if 
\code{prior.prob=TRUE}.}

\item{genomic.features}{Character vector or scalar indicating whether the 
gene set enrichment analysis should be restricted to CpGs from specific 
genomic locations. Options are "ALL", "TSS200","TSS1500","Body","1stExon",
"3'UTR","5'UTR","ExonBnd"; and the user can select any combination. Defaults
to "ALL".}

\item{sig.genes}{Logical, if true then the significant differentially 
methylated genes that overlap with the gene set of interest is outputted 
as the final column in the results table. Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
A data frame with a row for each gene set and the following columns:
\item{N}{ number of genes in the gene set } \item{DE}{ number of genes that
are differentially methylated } \item{P.DE}{ p-value for over-representation
of the gene set } \item{FDR}{ False discovery rate, calculated using the
method of Benjamini and Hochberg (1995).  } \item{SigGenesInSet}{ Significant 
differentially methylated genes overlapping with the gene set of interest. }
}
\description{
Given a user specified list of gene sets to test, \code{gsaregion} tests
whether differentially methylated regions (DMRs) identified from Illumina's
Infinium HumanMethylation450 or MethylationEPIC array are enriched, taking
into account the differing number of probes per gene present on the array.
}
\details{
This function extends \code{goregion}, which only tests GO and KEGG pathways.
\code{gsaregion} can take a list of user specified gene sets and test whether
the significant DMRs are enriched in these pathways. This function takes a
\code{GRanges} object of DMR coordinates, maps them to CpG sites on the
array and then to Entrez Gene IDs, and tests for enrichment using Wallenius' 
noncentral hypergeometric test, taking into account the number of CpG sites 
per gene on the 450K/EPIC array.  If \code{prior.prob} is set to FALSE, then 
prior probabilities are not used and it is assumed that each gene is equally
likely to have a significant CpG site associated with it. 

The testing now also takes into account that some CpGs map to multiple genes. 
For a small number of gene families, this previously caused their associated 
GO categories/gene sets to be erroneously overrepresented and thus highly 
significant. If \code{fract.counts=FALSE} then CpGs are allowed to map to 
multiple genes (this is NOT recommended).

Genes associated with each CpG site are obtained from the annotation package
\code{IlluminaHumanMethylation450kanno.ilmn12.hg19} if the array type is
"450K". For the EPIC array, the annotation package
\code{IlluminaHumanMethylationEPICanno.ilm10b4.hg19} is used. To use a
different annotation package, please supply it using the \code{anno}
argument. 

In order to get a list which contains the mapped Entrez gene IDS,
please use the \code{getMappedEntrezIDs} function. The \code{topGSA} function 
can be used to display the top 20 most enriched pathways.

If you are interested in which genes overlap with the genes in the gene set, 
setting \code{sig.genes} to TRUE will output an additional column in the 
results data frame that contains all the significant differentially 
methylated gene symbols, comma separated. The default is FALSE.
