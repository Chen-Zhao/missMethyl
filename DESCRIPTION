Description: Normalisation and testing for differential variability for
        data from Illumina's Infinium HumanMethylation450 array. The
        normalisation procedure is subset-quantile within-array
        normalisation (SWAN), which allows Infinium I and II type
        probes on a single array to be normalised together. The test
        for differential variability is based on an empirical Bayes
        version of Levene's test.
