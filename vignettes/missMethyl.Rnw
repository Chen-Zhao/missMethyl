\section{Introduction}

The \Biocpkg{missMethyl} package contains functions to analyse methylation data from Illumina's HumanMethylation450 beadchip. These arrays are a cost-effective alternative to whole genome bisulphite sequencing, and as such are widely used to profile DNA methylation. Specifically, missMethyl contains functions to perform SWAN normalisation \cite{swan} and differential variability analysis \cite{diffvar}. As our lab's research into specialised analyses of these arrays continues we anticipate that the package will be continuously updated with new functions.

Raw data files are in IDAT format, which can be read into R using the \Biocpkg{minfi} package \cite{minfi}. Statistical analyses are usually performed on M-values, and $\beta$ values are used for visualisation, both of which can be extracted from \Rclass{MethylSet} objects, which is a class of object created by \Biocpkg{minfi}. For detecting differentially variable CpGs we recommend that the analysis is performed on M-values. All analyses described here are performed at the CpG site level.

\section{Reading data into R}

We will use the data in the \Biocpkg{minfiData} package to demonstrate the functions in \Biocpkg{missMethyl}. The example dataset has 6 samples across two slides. The sample information is in the targets file. An essential column in the targets file is the ``Basename" column which tells \Biocpkg{minfi} where the idat files to be read in are located. The R commands to read in the data are taken from the \Biocpkg{minfi} Users Guide. For additional details on how to read the IDAT files into R, as well as information regarding quality control please refer to the \Biocpkg{minfi} User\'s Guide.

baseDir <- system.file("extdata", package = "minfiData")
targets <- read.450k.sheet(baseDir)
targets[,1:9]
targets[,10:12]
rgSet <- read.450k.exp(base = baseDir,targets = targets)
@

The data is now an \Rclass{RGChannelSet} object and needs to be normalised and converted to a \Rclass{MethylSet} object.  

\section{Subset-quantile within array normalization (SWAN)}

SWAN (subset-quantile within array normalization) is a within-array normalization method for Illumina 450k BeadChips. Technical differencs have been demonstrated to exist between the Infinium I and Infinium II assays on a single 450K array \cite{bibikova, dedeur}. Using the SWAN method substantially reduces the technical variability between the assay designs whilst maintaining the important biological differences. The SWAN method makes the assumption that the number of CpGs within the 50bp probe sequence reflects the underlying biology of the region being interrogated. Hence, the overall distribution of intensities of probes with the same number of CpGs in the probe body should be the same regardless of assay type. The method then uses a subset quantile normalization approach to adjust the intensities of each array \cite{swan}. 

SWAN can take a \Rclass{MethylSet}, \Rclass{RGChannelSet} or \Rclass{MethyLumiSet} as input. It should be noted that, in order to create the normalization subset, SWAN randomly selects Infinium I and II probes that have one, two and three underlying CpGs; as such, we recommend using \Rcode{set.seed} before \Rfunction{SWAN} to ensure that the normalized intensities will be identical, if the normalization is repeated.

The technical differences between Infinium I and II assay designs can result in aberrant beta value distributions (Figure \ref{fig:swan}, panel ``Raw''). Using SWAN corrects for the technical differences between the Infinium I and II assay designs and produces a smoother overall $\beta$ value distribution (Figure \ref{fig:swan}, panel ``SWAN'').

\section{Filter out poor quality probes}

Poor quality probes can be filtered out based on the detection p-value. For this example, to retain a CpG for further analysis, we require that the detection p-value is less than 0.01 in all samples.

<<filtering>>=
detP <- detectionP(rgSet)
keep <- rowSums(detP < 0.01) == ncol(rgSet)
mSet <- mSet[keep,]
@

\section{Extracting \texorpdfstring{$\beta$}{Lg} and M-values}

Now that the data has been SWAN normalised we can extract $\beta$ and M-values from the \Rclass{MethylSet} object. We prefer to add an offset to the methylated and unmethylated intensities when calculating M-values, hence we extract the methylated and unmethylated channels separately and perform our own calculation. For all subsequent analysis we use a random selection of 20\,000 CpGs to reduce computation time.

<<extraction>>=
mset_reduced <- mSet[sample(1:nrow(mSet), 20000),]
meth <- getMeth(mset_reduced)
unmeth <- getUnmeth(mset_reduced)
Mval <- log2((meth + 100)/(unmeth + 100))
beta <- getBeta(mset_reduced)
dim(Mval)
@

An MDS plot (Figure \ref{fig:MDS}) is a good sanity check to make sure samples cluster together according to the main factor of interest, in this case, cancer and normal.

\section{Testing for differential methylation}

To test for differential methylation we use the \Biocpkg{limma} package \cite{limma}, which employs an empirical Bayes framework based on Guassian model theory. First we need to set up the design matrix. There are a number of ways to do this, the most straightforward is directly from the targets file. There are a number of variables, with the status column indicating cancer/normal samples. From the person column of the targets file, we see that the cancer/normal samples are matched, with 3 individuals each contributing both a cancer and normal sample. Since the limma model framework can handle any experimental design which can be summarised by a design matrix, we can take into account the paired nature of the data in the analysis. For more complicated experimental designs, please refer to the \Biocpkg{limma} User\'s Guide.

<<design>>=
library(limma)
group <- factor(targets$status,levels=c("normal","cancer"))
id <- factor(targets$person)
design <- model.matrix(~id + group)
design
@

Now we can test for differential methylation using the \Rfunction{lmFit} and \Rfunction{eBayes} functions from \Biocpkg{limma}. As input data we use the matrix of M-values.

<<diffmeth>>=
fit <- lmFit(Mval,design)
fit <- eBayes(fit)
@

The numbers of hyper-methylated (1) and hypo-methylated (-1) can be displayed using the \Rfunction{decideTests} function in \Biocpkg{limma} and the top 10 differentially methylated CpGs for cancer versus normal outputted using \Rfunction{topTable}.

<<diffmeth_results>>=
summary(decideTests(fit))
top<-topTable(fit,coef=4)
top
@

Note that since we performed our analysis on M-values, the logFC and AveExpr columns are computed on the M-value scale. For interpretability and visualisation we can look at the $\beta$ values. The beta values for the top 4 differentially methylated CpGs shown in Figure \ref{fig:top4}.

\section{Removing unwanted variation when testing for differential methylation}

Like other platforms, 450k array studies are subject to unwanted technical variation such as batch effects and other, often unknown, sources of variation. The adverse effects of unwanted variation have been extensively documented in gene expression array studies and have been shown to be able to both reduce power to detect true differences and to increase the number of false discoveries. As such, when it is apparent that data is significantly affected by unwanted variation, it is advisable to perform an adjustment to mitigate its effects.   

\Biocpkg{missMethyl} provides a \Biocpkg{limma}-like interface to functions from the CRAN \CRANpkg{ruv} package that enables the removal of unwanted variation when performing a differential analysis. All of the \CRANpkg{ruv} methods rely on negative control features to accurately estimate the components of unwanted variation. Negative control features are probes/genes/etc. that are known \textit{a priori} to not truly be associated with the biological factor of interest, but are affected by unwanted variation. For example, in a microarray gene expression study, these could be house-keeping genes or a set of spike-in controls. Negative control features are extensively discussed in Gagnon-Bartsch and Speed (2012) \cite{G-B1} and Gagnon-Bartsch et al. (2013) \cite{G-B2}. Once the unwanted factors are accurate estimated from the data, they are adjusted for in the linear model that describes the differential analysis.  

If the negative control features are not known \textit{a priori}, they can be identified empirically. This can be done by initially performing a differential methylation analysis without any adjustment using \Biocpkg{limma}, as described in the previous section. For simplicity, we are ingnoring the paired nature of the cancer and normal samples in this example.

<<diffmeth2>>=
# get M-values for ALL probes
meth <- getMeth(mSet)
unmeth <- getUnmeth(mSet)
M <- log2((meth + 100)/(unmeth + 100))

library(limma)
grp <- factor(targets$status,levels=c("normal","cancer"))
des <- model.matrix(~grp)
des
fit <- lmFit(M,des)
fit <- eBayes(fit)
summary(decideTests(fit))
@

Now that we have performed an initial differential methylation analysis to rank the CpGs with respect to their association with the factor of interest, we can designate the CpGs that are least associated with the factor of interest based on FDR-adjusted p-value as negative control features.  

<<ruv1>>=
topTab <- topTable(fit, coef=2, num=Inf)
head(topTab)

ctl <- rownames(M) %in% rownames(topTab[topTab$adj.P.Val > 0.5,])
table(ctl)
@

We can now use the empirical controls to perform a differential methylation analysis using (by default) the RUV-inverse method, which is adjusted for the unwanted variation estimated from the data.

<<ruv2, cache=TRUE>>=
# Perform RUV adjustment and fit
rfit <- RUVfit(data=M, design=des, coef=2, ctl=ctl)
rfit2 <- RUVadj(rfit)

# Look at table of top results
topRUV(rfit2)
@

Note, at present RUVfit does not support contrasts, so only one factor of interest can be interrogated at a time using a design matrix with an intercept term. 

\section{Testing for differential variability (DiffVar)}

\subsection{Methylation data}

Rather than testing for differences in mean methylation, we may be interested in testing for differences between group variances. For example, it has been hypothesised that highly variable CpGs in cancer are important for tumour progression \cite{hansen}. Hence we may be interested in CpG sites that are consistently methylated in the normal samples, but variably methylated in the cancer samples. In general we recommend at least 10 samples in each group for accurate variance estimation, however for the purpose of this vignette we perform the analysis on 3 vs 3. In this example, we are interested in testing for differential variability in the cancer versus normal group. When we specify the \textit{coef} parameter, which corresponds to the columns of the design matrix to be used for testing differential variability, we specify both the intercept and the fourth column. The ID variable is a nuisance parameter and not used when obtained the absolute deviations, however it can be included in the linear modelling step. For methylation data, the \Rfunction{varFit} function will take either a matrix of M-values, $\beta$ values or a \Rclass{MethylSet} object as input. If $\beta$ values are supplied, a logit transformation is performed. Note that as a default, \Rfunction{varFit} uses the robust setting in the \Biocpkg{limma} framework, which requires the use of the \CRANpkg{statmod} package.

<<diffvar>>=
fitvar <- varFit(Mval, design = design, coef = c(1,4))
@

The numbers of hyper-variable (1) and hypo-variable (-1) genes in cancer vs normal can be obtained using \Rfunction{decideTests}. 

<<diffvar_results>>=
summary(decideTests(fitvar))
topDV <- topVar(fitvar, coef=4)
topDV
@

An alternate parameterisation of the design matrix that does not include an intercept term can also be used, and specific contrasts tested with \Rfunction{contrasts.varFit}. Here we specify the design matrix such that the first two columns correspond to the normal and cancer groups, respectively.

<<alternative>>=
design2 <- model.matrix(~0+group+id)
fitvar.contr <- varFit(Mval, design=design2, coef=c(1,2))
contr <- makeContrasts(groupcancer-groupnormal,levels=colnames(design2))
fitvar.contr <- contrasts.varFit(fitvar.contr,contrasts=contr)
@

The results are identical to before.

<<altresults>>=
summary(decideTests(fitvar.contr))
topVar(fitvar.contr,coef=1)
@

The $\beta$ values for the top 4 differentially variable CpGs can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:top4DV}.

<<top4DV,fig.width=10,fig.height=10>>=

vertical=TRUE,cex.axis=1.5,cex.lab=1.5)
title(cpgsDV[i],cex.main=1.5)
}
@

\end{figure}

\subsection{RNA-Seq expression data}

Testing for differential variability in expression data is straightforward if the technology is gene expression microarrays. The matrix of expression values can be supplied directly to the \Rfunction{varFit} function. For RNA-Seq data, the mean-variance relationship that occurs in count data needs to be taken into account. In order to deal with this issue, we apply a \Rfunction{voom} transformation \cite{voom} to obtain observation weights, which are then used in the linear modelling step. For RNA-Seq data, the \Rfunction{varFit} function will take a \Rclass{DGEList} object as input.

To demonstrate this, we use data from the \Biocpkg{tweeDEseqCountData} package. This data is part of the International HapMap project, consisting of RNA-Seq profiles from 69 unrelated Nigerian individuals \cite{pickrell}. The only covariate is gender, so we can look at differentially variable expression between males and females. We follow the code from the \Biocpkg{limma} vignette to read in and process the data before testing for differential variability.

First we load up the data and extract the relevant information.

<<loadingdata>>=
library(tweeDEseqCountData)
data(pickrell1)
counts<-exprs(pickrell1.eset)
dim(counts)
gender <- pickrell1.eset$gender
table(gender)
rm(pickrell1.eset)
data(genderGenes)
data(annotEnsembl63)
annot <- annotEnsembl63[,c("Symbol","Chr")]
rm(annotEnsembl63)
@

We now have the counts, gender of each sample and annotation (gene symbol and chromosome) for each Ensemble gene. We can form a \Rclass{DGEList} object using the \Biocpkg{edgeR} package.

<<dgelist>>=
library(edgeR)
y <- DGEList(counts=counts, genes=annot[rownames(counts),])
@

We filter out lowly expressed genes by keeping genes with at least 1 count per million reads in at least 20 samples, as well as genes that have defined annotation. Finally we perform scaling normalisation.

<<dgelist_filtering>>=
isexpr <- rowSums(cpm(y)>1) >= 20
hasannot <- rowSums(is.na(y$genes))==0
y <- y[isexpr & hasannot,,keep.lib.sizes=FALSE]
dim(y)
y <- calcNormFactors(y)
@

We set up the design matrix and test for differential variability. In this case there are no nuisance parameters, so \textit{coef} does not need to be explicitly specified.

<<testhapmap>>=
design.hapmap <- model.matrix(~gender)
fitvar.hapmap <- varFit(y, design = design.hapmap)
fitvar.hapmap$genes <- y$genes
@

We can display the results of the test:

<<resultshapmap>>=
summary(decideTests(fitvar.hapmap))
topDV.hapmap <- topVar(fitvar.hapmap,coef=ncol(design.hapmap))
topDV.hapmap
@

The log counts per million for the top 4 differentially variable genes can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:top4DVhapmap}.

\begin{figure}[htbp!]
\centering
<<top4DVhapmap,fig.width=10,fig.height=10>>=
